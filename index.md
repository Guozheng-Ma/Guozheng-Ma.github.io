<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
<a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/"><img src="/assets/Logo/NTU.svg" alt="NTU" width="15" height="18"> Nanyang Technological University</a>. I am a final-year master student at <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/"><img src="/assets/Logo/THU.png" alt="THU" width="18" height="18" style="vertical-align: middle;"> Tsinghua University</a>, with my research focused on Visual Reinforcement Learning and Data Augmentation. Prior to that, I completed my bachelor's degree at <a href="http://www-en.hnu.edu.cn/"><img src="/assets/Logo/HNU.jpg" alt="HNU" width="18" height="18"> Hunan University</a>, where I cherished four wonderful years at the foothills of Yuelu Mountain.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
My research interests broadly pertain to the distinctive challenges in <a href="">DEEP Reinforcement Learning</a>. Mitigating the constraints that arise when integrating deep neural networks with RL paradigms is crucial for unlocking the scaling law of RL, determining whether the real <a href="">DEEP RL</a> agents can continuously learn from new experiences, and adapt in dynamic tasks and environments.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
In this era marked by the advent of AGI, I am also deeply concerned about the <a href="">value alignment</a> of AI agents, both from a technical perspective and a social science viewpoint.

<!-- Motto -->
<p style="text-align:center; font-family:'Pacifico', cursive; font-size:1.05em; margin-top: 40px; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
  Greatness cannot be planned, so I play with joyful explorations!
